🔧 Design and Implementation of RISC-V IP with Hard Macro Creation and Integration  
📌 Objective  
To design and implement a RISC-V-based IP core with a focus on Hard Macro Creation and Integration, optimizing for area, power, and performance at a 32nm technology node.  

🔍 Key Focus Areas  
✅ Hard Macro Design: Developed and implemented two hard macros for critical RISC-V sub-modules (e.g., ALU and Machine Counter) with strict area and performance targets.  
✅ Integration into Top-Level: Seamlessly integrated hard macros into the SoC-level design using optimized floorplanning, placement, and routing strategies.  
✅ Timing & Power Optimization: Achieved timing closure and power targets through multiple optimization loops and thorough static timing analysis (STA).
