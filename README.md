Design and Implementation of RISC-V IP with Hard Macro Creation and Integration  
Objective  
Design and Implemented RISC-V IP with Hard Macro Creation and Integration.  

Key Focus Areas
Designed and implemented two hard macros for RISC-V sub-modules, meeting area, power, and performance constraints.  
Integrated the hard macros into the top-level design with optimized floor planning, placement, and routing.  
Optimized design to meet timing closure and power constraints using static timing analysis.
